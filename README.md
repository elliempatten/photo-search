This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Unsplash Photo Search
This app uses the Unsplash API to retrieve a scrollable page of photos based on a user's search input.

## Note
To use this app, you MUST provide a developer API key in the updateComponent() method of the PhotosList component!

To run the app, from the unsplash-photos directory, use:
npm start
